Tanki Online model, map and library conversion for Godot(or any)

## Features
* Convert maps from old XML format to new LegacyMap JSON format
* Convert libraries from 3DS+XML to GLB+JSON
* (Optional) Replace old textures with Hi-Res textures
* (Optional) Add normal maps to models

## TODO
* JSON map format doesnt have collision, spawn point, gamemodes and bonus data
* Some other obscure quirks that I have yet to discover?
